## Description

I have created a burger logger utilizing the power of MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This application has followed the MVC design pattern, using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML file.

Please find the deployed application from here deloyed on Heroku:

## How to install dependencies
